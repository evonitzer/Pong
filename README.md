# Pong
For a class assignment in college, I wrote a pong program in Java.  It's not really pong since the ball only bounces against
the opposite and side walls and there is no consequence for letting it past the paddle, but these are things that can be improved.  As a way of learning Python, I'm going to convert this code over as best I can.
